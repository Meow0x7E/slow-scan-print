    Read text from standard input or files and print output character by character or line by line with a configurable time interval.
    The tool name is inspired by Slow Scan Television (SSTV).

      Set the character print delay time (default unit: seconds), supports simple arithmetic operations (+, *)

      Time unit reference:
      Unit      Time Scale    Aliases (case-insensitive)
      --------  -----------   --------------------------
      y         year          y, year
      mon       month         mon, month
      w         week          w, week
      d         day           d, day
      h         hour          h, hr, hour
      m         minute        m, M, minute, min
      s         second        s, second, sec
      ms        millisecond   ms, millisecond, msec
      µs        microsecond   µs, µsecond, microsecond, µsec
      ns        nanosecond    ns, nanosecond, nsec

      Examples:
      1.5h30m   → 1 hour and 30 minutes
      100ms * 2 → 200 milliseconds
      1 + 1 + 100ms → 2100 milliseconds
  full_width_delay: Set the print time for full-width characters. The default value is twice the delay value. Acceptable values are the same as the delay parameter.
  control_char_delay: Set the print time for control characters. The default value is zero. Acceptable values are the same as the delay parameter.
  tail_delay: Whether to add a delay after the last character. By default, the program exits immediately after printing the last character without waiting.
  hide_cursor: Hide the terminal cursor during printing and restore it afterwards.
  line_mode: Enable line-by-line printing mode.
  files: Specify input file path(s) (supports multiple files). Read from stdin if no arguments are provided or if the argument is "-" (to select a file named "-", use "./-").

error:

    Failed to register Ctrl+C interrupt handler, which may cause abnormal cursor state upon exit.
    This prompt can be suppressed by closing stderr.
